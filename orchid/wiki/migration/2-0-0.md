Most of the changes are under the hood, they do not affect the API usage.

But, some changes cause a major incompatibility to previous versions.

## Subcommands

This change pretty much affects only Kotlin users. The method `getSubCommands()` has been replaced by the class attribute `subCommands`. Instances of subcommands will be created **only once** now, not on every call. This behavior may be reverted by defining a getter which calls a custom method.

Before change:

```kotlin
override fun getSubCommands(): ArrayList<PocketCommand> {
    return arrayListOf(
        ReloadCommand(plugin),
        GuiCommand(plugin),
        NotesCommand(plugin)
    )
}
```

After change:

```kotlin
override val subCommands = arrayListOf(
    ReloadCommand(plugin),
    GuiCommand(plugin),
    NotesCommand(plugin)
)
```

## Removal of unused/useless API code

### UUIDUtils#lookup

The method `UUIDUtils.lookup()` has been removed, as such a feature is implemented in Bukkit itself. Also, using `Bukkit.getOfflinePlayer(name: String)` is deprecated, as names are not unique to a user account.
