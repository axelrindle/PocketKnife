PocketKnife is designed to automate common tasks by providing boilerplate code that is reusable. Configuration management, command handling and tab-completion, inventory management as well as localization are currently supported.

All of the main components are semi-automated, meaning they work properly with very few configuration steps. In addition to that some utility classes exist providing an extra bit of useful functionality that might be common for many tasks.

Developers can focus on their plugin's functionality and don't have to mess with boilerplate code that makes the code look like a mess sometimes.
