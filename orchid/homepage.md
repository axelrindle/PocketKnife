Welcome to the documentation website for `PocketKnife`. What you can find here is the API documentation as well as usage examples for the main components.

Most of the source code is thoroughly documented and should be self-explanatory in general. If you think this is not the case, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/axelrindle/PocketKnife/issues/new) or a [pull request](https://github.com/axelrindle/PocketKnife/compare).
